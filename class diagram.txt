This is a design level class diagram. The topmost class DocumentManagementSystem
is the main class which represents the full application. There are Admin, dms master and
User classes which are connected to main class with aggregation means having whole/-
part relationship, indicating that the DocumentManagementSystem is the whole class
and above 3 classes are the part classes. Our aim is to keep admin and user sides dif-
ferent so we have split them into two. The dms master is the MySQL database, it is
basically the database name. The main class has the login function where the user name
and password are the parameters. The Admin communicates with dms master to up-
load files and to request files/documents. In the same way User also communicates with
dms master, the only difference is user can access that data which Admin has given it
the access to.
The User class consists of EventUser class. The EventUser is so named because it
represents that the users can upload documents related to event. They can access the
documents event wise. They can upload files, photos, etc. They will be able to access
those documents which they have uploaded and also those which they have right to ac-
cess. These rights are given to them by the Admin. The event also will be assigned by
the Admin to all users.
The Admin is the one who has all rights. Admin can upload documents in any
event and can view all the documents uploaded by the users. Admin can add and delete
events using the EventAdmin class. Admin can assign events to users. Admin can list
all event with their descriptions using the ListAdmin. Admin can add event along with
their description. Like events Admin can also add and delete users using the UserAdmin
class. Only Admin has the right to add users. Admin can view the list of users using
ListUsers class. EventAdmin ListEvents and UserAdmin ListUsers are connected using
realization relationship.
Now the dms master is the name of the database. It has tables dms users, dms event,
dms data master and dms data. The dms users consists of fields userid, username, full-
name and password. This table consists all the users credentials necessary for them to
access their accounts. In the main class when user enters account credentials then that
username and password are compared from this table. When Admin adds a new user
this entry is added to this table. The dms event table has the list of events. It consists
of attributes eventid, eventname and description. Each event has an eventid associated 
with it. The main table of all is the dms data master. When a new document is added
to a particular event the corresponding eventid and userid are added to this table. Now
this unique dmid is generated. This dmid is then added in dms data along with the file
name that was uploaded. This file is physically present in a folder on the structure. The
file name is only inserted in the dms table along with eventid and userid. The database
is normalized means the redundancy in data is reduced. The dms data is dependent on
dms data master so they are connected with dependency relationship.
