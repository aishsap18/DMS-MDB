A document management system for organization is a system used to manage and store
documents and reduce manual storage. If any such system were not implemented people
would have to preserve all the documents manually and when with time the number of
files would have increased the management of all the files would have become a tedious
job. Thus with the help of document management system users will be able to store all
the documents in a central data repository and access them whenever the need be and from
any place.
