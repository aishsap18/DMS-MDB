There are many kinds of applications or software components to manage files in a
local computer, but it is very difficult to organize personal documents in a consistent
way and to search expected ones in a proper way. When users upload documents in
their computers, they have to remember file names or locations to search them. A file-
searching tool such as Windows Explorer usually relies on information about the physical features of the file (i.e. format, etc). Although people remember the
names and the paths of the files stored in their computer, it would be difficult
to find the right ones without knowing their contents. So there comes a need of a
online document management system that will help users to upload, manage, organize
and find desired documents easily and faster. Proposed system is document management
system which is used for the education purpose to organizing documents and access those
documents from any where and any time.
